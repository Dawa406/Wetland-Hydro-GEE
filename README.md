# Wetland-Hydro-GEE
Mapping wetland hydrological dynamics using Google Earth Engine (GEE)

This repo was created to share the Google Earth Engine source code and results for the following manuscript currently under review at *Remote Sensing of Environment*. 

* **Wu, Q.** , Lane C.R., Li, X., Zhao, K., Zhou, Y., Clinton, N., DeVries, B., Golden, H.E., & Lang, M.W. (2018). Integrating LiDAR data and multi-temporal aerial imagery to map wetland inundation dynamics on Google Earth Engine. *Remote Sensing of Environment*. (under review)

## Source Code

We have developed a GUI application (**Wetland Hydrology Analyst**) for mapping wetland inundation dynamics using multi-temporal aerial imagery and LiDAR data. The application can be found in our public GEE repository. To access the application, visit this URL: https://code.earthengine.google.com/?accept_repo=users/giswqs/public). It will add the users/giswqs/public repository to your GEE account. Once added, the repository can be found within the Reader permission group of your GEE scripts library. There youâ€™ll find the user interface applications - **Wetland Hydrology Analyst**.

Alternatively, you can directly open the application via the link below:
