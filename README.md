**Mapping wetland hydrological dynamics using Google Earth Engine (GEE)**

Author: Qiusheng Wu (https://wetlands.io | wqs@binghamton.edu)

This repo was created to share the Google Earth Engine App for the following manuscript currently under review at *Remote Sensing of Environment*. 

* **Wu, Q.**, Lane, C.R., Li, X., Zhao, K., Zhou, Y., Clinton, N., DeVries, B., Golden, H.E., & Lang, M.W. (2018). Integrating LiDAR data and multi-temporal aerial imagery to map wetland inundation dynamics on Google Earth Engine. *Remote Sensing of Environment*. (under review)

## Google Earth Engine Apps

We have developed a GUI application (**Wetland Hydrology Analyst**) for mapping wetland inundation dynamics using multi-temporal aerial imagery and LiDAR data. To access the application, visit this URL: https://wqs.users.earthengine.app/view/wetland-hydro-gee
